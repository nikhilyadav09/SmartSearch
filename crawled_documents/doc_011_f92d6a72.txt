This week's article for improvement is: Internet research Previous selections: Stuffed toy · Honshu · Plate (dishware) This week's backlog of the week is: Category:Avoided double redirects to be updated Newest featured content Tip of the day Sometimes you may be editing an article and want to link a plural to its singular form. For example, to link "Fred Foo was famous for his study of puddles" to puddle, you could link it like so: [[puddle|puddles]]. However, you can save time instead by writing [[puddle]]s. This also works with adjectives (for example, [[Japan]]ese), regular verbs in present or past tense (for example, [[dance]]s or [[dance]]d) and any other suffixes or prefixes. However, this method does not work with spelling changes, for example: [[try]]ied does not work; you have to enter [[try|tried]]. It also does not work with possessives, so you may want to use [[Fred Foo|Fred Foo's]] to get Fred Foo's. Using [[Fred Foo]]'s will look like Fred Foo's, i.e. the possessive suffix unlinked, in plain text, and black instead of blue. Note: if a redirect exists from puddles to puddle you don't actually need to do any piping, it's fine to link [[puddles]] too.
