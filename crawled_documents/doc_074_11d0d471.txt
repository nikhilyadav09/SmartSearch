In first-order logic, a Herbrand structure S {\displaystyle S} is a structure over a vocabulary σ {\displaystyle \sigma } (also sometimes called a signature) that is defined solely by the syntactical properties of σ {\displaystyle \sigma } . The idea is to take the symbol strings of terms as their values, e.g. the denotation of a constant symbol c {\displaystyle c} is just " c {\displaystyle c} " (the symbol). It is named after Jacques Herbrand. Herbrand structures play an important role in the foundations of logic programming.[1] Herbrand universe Definition The Herbrand universe serves as the universe in a Herbrand structure. Example Let L σ {\displaystyle L^{\sigma }} , be a first-order language with the vocabulary then the Herbrand universe H {\displaystyle H} of L σ {\displaystyle L^{\sigma }} (or of σ {\displaystyle \sigma } ) is H = { c , f ( c ) , g ( c ) , f ( f ( c ) ) , f ( g ( c ) ) , g ( f ( c ) ) , g ( g ( c ) ) , … } {\displaystyle H=\{c,f(c),g(c),f(f(c)),f(g(c)),g(f(c)),g(g(c)),\dots \}} The relation symbols are not relevant for a Herbrand universe since formulas involving only relations do not correspond to elements of the universe.[2] Herbrand structure A Herbrand structure interprets terms on top of a Herbrand universe. Definition Let S {\displaystyle S} be a structure, with vocabulary σ {\displaystyle \sigma } and universe U {\displaystyle U} . Let W {\displaystyle W} be the set of all terms over σ {\displaystyle \sigma } and W 0 {\displaystyle W_{0}} be the subset of all variable-free terms. S {\displaystyle S} is said to be a Herbrand structure iff Remarks Examples For a constant symbol c {\displaystyle c} and a unary function symbol f ( ⋅ ) {\displaystyle f(\,\cdot \,)} we have the following interpretation: Herbrand base In addition to the universe, defined in § Herbrand universe, and the term denotations, defined in § Herbrand structure, the Herbrand base completes the interpretation by denoting the relation symbols. Definition A Herbrand base B H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{H}} for a Herbrand structure is the set of all atomic formulas whose argument terms are elements of the Herbrand universe. Examples For a binary relation symbol R {\displaystyle R} , we get with the terms from above: See also Notes References
