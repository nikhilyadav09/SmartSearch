Melvin Earl "Bill" Maron (Jan 23, 1924 - September 28, 2016) was an American computer scientist and emeritis professor of University of California, Berkeley.[1] He studied mechanical engineering and physics at the University of Nebraska and received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of California in 1951.[2] Maron is best known for his work on probabilistic information retrieval which he published together with his friend and colleague Lary Kuhns.[3][4] Quite remarkably, Maron also pioneered relational databases, proposing a system called the Relational Data File in 1967, on which Ted Codd based his Relational model of data.[5] References This article about an American scientist in academia is a stub.
