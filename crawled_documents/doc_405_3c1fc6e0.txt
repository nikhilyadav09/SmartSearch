Welcome! Hello, and welcome to WikiProject Reliability. This WikiProject is dedicated to improving the reliability of Wikipedia articles. We ensure that articles are supported by reliable sources, answer inquiries on the reliable sources noticeboard, and maintain a list of frequently discussed sources. This project works to achieve the goals of the verifiability and no original research policies. If you would like to help, please join the project, participate on the talk page and see the open tasks below. Getting started Quick help Scope and goals Scope This WikiProject covers all articles on Wikipedia. Goals Guidelines Articles with no references Articles based on a single source If the article has only one reference or external link (that is related to the article content), use {{one source}} to put the article in Category:Articles lacking sources. Articles with partial or incomplete sources For an article with partial sources, add the templates {{refimprove}} or {{primary sources}}. This will automatically add the article to Category:Articles needing additional references or Category:Articles lacking reliable references. Articles with questionable resources For an article with questionable resources, add the templates {{verify source}} or {{verify credibility}} to put the article in to Category:Wikipedia articles needing factual verification. Articles with statements that lack references For an article with small numbers of statements lacking references, add the template {{citation needed}} or {{citations missing}}. This will automatically add the article to Category:Articles with unsourced statements. Other maintenance templates are available at Category:Citation and verifiability maintenance templates. Open tasks How can I help now? There are a number of different Wikipedia Backlog categories that help track the existing backlog of referencing activities. They fall into two major groups, Lacking references and Ensuring accuracy through existing references. Help now: Solve Citations Needed! At the moment, there are over 546,031 articles with "Citation needed" statements. They are some of the easiest referencing issues to solve, because you are frequently looking for a targeted and singular reference. You can browse the whole list of these articles at Category:All articles with unsourced statements. With 546,031 statements that need WP:Verification, sometimes it's hard to choose which article to work on. The tool Citation Hunt makes that easier by suggesting random articles, which you can sort by topical category membership.
